<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the Capstone project that signs the completion of the Javascript module in Microverse Curriculum.
It is a browser game where users can play an orc and collect stars earning points in a limited period of time.

### How to Play

A character can be controled wit arrow keys(UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Try to collect as many stars as possible!

### Design Process

Initially a game was designed as a turned-based RPG about fantasy creatures battles. But because of the severe reality the game is what it is now.
At the end of the day 2 I have learned basics of Phaser. I have created scenes, added objects to the scenes, added collisions and assets to the scenes. The rest of the days have been organized as following:
* Implemented the logic of the game.
* Implemented the API service scoring system.
* Implemented tests for Scenes and API.
